<H2> What is this? </H2>
This repository serves as a personal note vault for any content that I personally need to review while I complete my Bachelor's in Software Development. 

Because this content is only information I need to review, notes are incomplete and often are only specific sections of a course.
<h2> Can I use this? </h2>
While this content is suitable to be used, I both encourage and implore you to take this content and curate it towards your personal note-taking tastes.

<h2> What resources are used to create notes? </h2>
Any content is taken directly from WGU learning resources. If external sources is used, a link is embedded.
