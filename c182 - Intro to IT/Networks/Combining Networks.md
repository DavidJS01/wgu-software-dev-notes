<h2> What devices can be used to connect networks? </h2>
**Repeaters:**
Repeaters ***extend the range*** of cabling types so connections can be made by increasing the strength of the network signal

**Bridges:**
Bridges **connect to different types of networks** and provide **management of the message**. 

For example, a bridge can connect a twisted pair and coaxial network and only bridges the two networks if a message is addressed to a device on the other side.

**Switches:**
Switches are used on LANs to **reduce network traffic** by managment of network messages

**Routers:**
A router connected to your LAN (also called a Gateway) acts as a gateway to the internet.

It manages network traffic by having a routing table of known devices: if the destination address is unnown, it forwards the message to another router until the message reaches the correct address.
