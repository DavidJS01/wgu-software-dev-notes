**What is a network?**
A network is a collection of two or more connected devices that communicate with one another

<h2> Transmission Media </h2>
**What is a transmission medium?**
A transmission medium is a network component that carries data from one network device to another.

**How does data travel through a network?**
Data travels through a network using communication channels that connect network components.

**What do wired and wireless networks need for data transfer?**
Both wired and wireless networks need network media to transfer data:
1. Wired Networks
	1. Twisted pair cables
	2. Coaxial cables
	3. Optical fiber cables
2. Wireless Networks
	1. Radio waves
	2. Microwaves
	3. Infrared waves

**What is the most widely used type of transmission media?**
Twisted pair cables are the most widely used type of transmission media. 

**What are the two types of twisted pair cables?**
There are two types of [twisted pair cables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twisted_pair):
1. UTP - Unshielded Twisted Pair
	1. Most common cable used in networking
	2. Great for short to medium-length connections
2. STP - Shieleded Twisted Pair
	1. Two separately insulated copper wires around each other
		1. More expensive than UTP for that reason
		2. Protects wires from nieghboring unshielded cables and electromagentic interference

<h2> Network Bandwith </h2>
Network bandwidth is typically measured in megabits per second (Mbps) and gigabits (Gbps) per second.

| Category | Maxiumum Bandwith |
|-----------|----------------------|
| CAT1 | 1 Mbps |
| CAT2 | 4 Mbps |
| CAT3 | 10 Mbps |
| CAT4 | 16 Mbps |
| CAT5 | 100 Mbps|
| CAT5e | 1 Gbps |
| CAT6 | 10 Gbps |
| CAT6a | 10 Gbps |
| CAT7 | 10 Gbps |

<H2> Coaxial Cables </H2>
**What is a coaxial cable?**
A coaxial cable is a shielded and insulated copper cable used in computer networks and to deliver cable TV

**How does it compare to twisted cables?**
A coaxial cable has about 80 times the bandwith of twisted wires, so typically modems and televisions use coaxial cables. It is used for both *broadband* and *baseband* communication.

**What is the difference between broadband and baseband?**
1. Baseband
