<h2> Networks</h2>
**What is a network?**
A network is a collection of two or more connected devices that communicate with one another

<h2> Transmission Media </h2>
**What is a transmission medium?**
A transmission medium is a network component that carries data from one network device to another.

**How does data travel through a network?**
Data travels through a network using communication channels that connect network components.

**What do wired and wireless networks need for data transfer?**
Both wired and wireless networks need network media to transfer data:
1. Wired Networks
	1. Twisted pair cables
	2. Coaxial cables
	3. Optical fiber cables
2. Wireless Networks
	1. Radio waves
	2. Microwaves
	3. Infrared waves

**What is the most widely used type of transmission media?**
Twisted pair cables are the most widely used type of transmission media. 

**What are the two types of twisted pair cables?**
There are two types of [twisted pair cables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twisted_pair):
1. UTP - Unshielded Twisted Pair
	1. Most common cable used in networking
	2. Great for short to medium-length connections
2. STP - Shieleded Twisted Pair
	1. Two separately insulated copper wires around each other
		1. More expensive than UTP for that reason
		2. Protects wires from nieghboring unshielded cables and electromagentic interference

<h2> Network Bandwith </h2>
Network bandwidth is typically measured in megabits per second (Mbps) and gigabits (Gbps) per second.

| Category | Maxiumum Bandwith |
|-----------|----------------------|
| CAT1 | 1 Mbps |
| CAT2 | 4 Mbps |
| CAT3 | 10 Mbps |
| CAT4 | 16 Mbps |
| CAT5 | 100 Mbps|
| CAT5e | 1 Gbps |
| CAT6 | 10 Gbps |
| CAT6a | 10 Gbps |
| CAT7 | 10 Gbps |

<H2> Coaxial Cables </H2>
**What is a coaxial cable?**
A coaxial cable is a shielded and insulated copper cable used in computer networks and to deliver cable TV

**How does it compare to twisted cables?**
A coaxial cable has about 80 times the bandwith of twisted wires, so typically modems and televisions use coaxial cables. 

**What are the two broadcast methods a coaxial cable can use?**
Coaxial cables use both *broadband* and *baseband* communication.

**What is the difference between broadband and baseband?**
1. Baseband
	1. A signal at a very narrow frequency range which data or information is [superimposed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superimposition) and then transmitted
		1. Ethernet LANs
		2. Serial cables 
2. Broadband
	1. High capacity transmission technologies to transmit data, voice, video across long distances and at high speeds
		1. Coaxial cable
		2. Fiber optic cable
		3. Radio waves

<h2>Fiber-Optic Cable</h2>
**How do fiber-optic cables work?**
Light travels down a fiber-optic cable by [bouncing off the walls of the cable repeatedly](https://www.nai-group.com/optical-fiber-technology-how-it-works/), and those pulses of light transmit data

**How much data can fiber-optic cables transmit?**
Fiber-optic cables can transmit large volumes of data: *26,000* times the bandwith of twisted pair wires
<h2> Wireless Transmissions</h2>
**What allows data to be transferred wirelessly?**
Electromagentic waves of different frequencies, like infared or radio waves, can be used to transmit data within a network using Wi-Fi or Bluetooth
